        <p>Hello! Welcome to "Learning Japanese"! In this page, you will find information and tips to begin learning japanese from scratch.
        But before we dive in in the actual learning, let's start with information about the language itself:</p>

        <h4>The Japanese Language</h4>

        <p>Japanese is an East Asian language spoken by about 128 million people, primarily in Japan, where it is the national language. 
        It is a member of the Japonic (or Japanese-Ryukyuan) language family, and its relation to other languages, such as Korean, 
        is debated.</p>
        <p>Little is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century 
        recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period 
        (794–1185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese 
        (1185–1600) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, and the first appearance of 
        European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the 
        Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th century–mid-19th century). Following the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation 
        in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords, in particular, 
        have become frequent, and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated.</p>

        <p>Japanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with simple phonotactics, a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and 
        consonant length, and a lexically significant pitch-accent. Word order is normally subject–object–verb with particles 
        marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is topic–comment. Sentence-final particles are used 
        to add emotional or emphatic impact, or make questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no 
        articles. Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person. Japanese equivalents of adjectives are 
        also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative 
        status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.</p>

        <p>Japanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese, but it makes extensive use of Chinese characters, or kanji, in its 
        writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from Chinese. Along with kanji, the Japanese writing 
        system primarily uses two syllabic scripts, hiragana and katakana. Latin script is used in a limited fashion, such as 
        for imported acronyms, and the numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals alongside traditional Chinese numerals.</p>

        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
