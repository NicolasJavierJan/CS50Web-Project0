# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For my Project 0, I designed a simple webpage to help you take your first steps in learning japanese, modeled after the first japanese class I took.
In index.html there's a little introduction to the language itself and some of its story.
In hiragana-katakana.html I dive right into the japanese syllabaries, hiragana and katakana, with a table showing the correspondence with letters. 
In jikoshoukai.html starts the japanese learning itself, with the way to introduce yourself in japanese, including very basic vocabulary.
In resources.html I list a series of resources that can help you in self-teaching yourself japanese.
